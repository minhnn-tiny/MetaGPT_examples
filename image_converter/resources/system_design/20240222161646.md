## Implementation approach

To address the requirements, we will leverage Streamlit for the web interface due to its simplicity and effectiveness in creating data applications with Python. For the image conversion process, we will use the Pillow library (PIL fork) as it supports a wide range of file formats and provides powerful image processing capabilities. This approach ensures that the application is user-friendly and requires no additional packages for setup, aligning with the project goals.

## Data structures and interfaces


classDiagram
    class StreamlitApp {
        +run() void
    }
    class ImageConverter {
        +convert_image(input_image: Image) Image
    }
    class ImageUploader {
        +upload_image() Image
    }
    class ImageDownloader {
        +download_image(output_image: Image) void
    }
    StreamlitApp --> ImageConverter
    StreamlitApp --> ImageUploader
    StreamlitApp --> ImageDownloader


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant SA as StreamlitApp
    participant IU as ImageUploader
    participant IC as ImageConverter
    participant ID as ImageDownloader
    SA->>IU: upload_image()
    IU-->>SA: return input_image
    SA->>IC: convert_image(input_image)
    IC-->>SA: return output_image
    SA->>ID: download_image(output_image)
    ID-->>SA: return


## Anything UNCLEAR

The project requirements are clear. However, the exact specifications for maintaining the quality of the converted image need further clarification, such as acceptable levels of compression and color profile handling.
