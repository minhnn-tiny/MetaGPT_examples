## Original Requirements

Create a convert image from png to jpg format based on streamlit. User can upload the image and download the converted image through web UI. Please make sure others can execute directly without introducing additional packages.

## Product Goals

- Develop an intuitive and user-friendly web interface for image conversion
- Ensure high-quality image conversion from PNG to JPG
- Enable easy setup and execution without additional package dependencies

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to easily upload a PNG image and have it converted to JPG format
- As a user, I want to download the converted JPG image directly from the web interface
- As a user, I want to ensure the quality of the converted image is maintained
- As a user, I want to use the converter on any device without installing extra software

## Competitive Analysis

- Online-convert.com: Offers multiple format conversions but requires navigating through ads
- Zamzar.com: User-friendly but conversion quality varies
- Cloudconvert.com: High-quality conversions but requires sign-up for multiple uses
- Convertio.co: Easy to use but limited free conversions
- Iloveimg.com: Quick conversions but with quality loss for larger files
- Freeconvert.com: Versatile but slower conversion process
- Image.online-convert.com: Direct conversion but interface is not very intuitive

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires building a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to convert images from PNG to JPG format. The key requirements include a user-friendly interface for uploading and downloading images, high-quality image conversion, and minimal setup effort. The solution must operate without necessitating additional packages, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement Streamlit web interface for uploading PNG images']
- ['P0', 'Develop conversion algorithm from PNG to JPG ensuring high quality']
- ['P1', 'Design download functionality for converted JPG images']
- ['P1', 'Ensure the application runs with no additional packages required']
- ['P2', 'Optimize the web interface for use on various devices and screen sizes']

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a simple and clean layout with two main functions: an upload button for PNG images and a download link/button for the converted JPG image. The design will be responsive, ensuring usability across devices. Feedback on the conversion process (e.g., success or error messages) will be clearly displayed to the user.
