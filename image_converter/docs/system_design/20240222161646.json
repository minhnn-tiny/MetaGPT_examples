{"Implementation approach":"To address the requirements, we will leverage Streamlit for the web interface due to its simplicity and effectiveness in creating data applications with Python. For the image conversion process, we will use the Pillow library (PIL fork) as it supports a wide range of file formats and provides powerful image processing capabilities. This approach ensures that the application is user-friendly and requires no additional packages for setup, aligning with the project goals.","File list":["app.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class StreamlitApp {\n        +run() void\n    }\n    class ImageConverter {\n        +convert_image(input_image: Image) Image\n    }\n    class ImageUploader {\n        +upload_image() Image\n    }\n    class ImageDownloader {\n        +download_image(output_image: Image) void\n    }\n    StreamlitApp --> ImageConverter\n    StreamlitApp --> ImageUploader\n    StreamlitApp --> ImageDownloader\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant SA as StreamlitApp\n    participant IU as ImageUploader\n    participant IC as ImageConverter\n    participant ID as ImageDownloader\n    SA->>IU: upload_image()\n    IU-->>SA: return input_image\n    SA->>IC: convert_image(input_image)\n    IC-->>SA: return output_image\n    SA->>ID: download_image(output_image)\n    ID-->>SA: return\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The project requirements are clear. However, the exact specifications for maintaining the quality of the converted image need further clarification, such as acceptable levels of compression and color profile handling."}
