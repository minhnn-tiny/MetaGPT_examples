## Implementation approach

We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of candidate teams of size `j` that can be formed using the first `i` cooks. We will then iterate over the cooks and for each cook, we will consider all possible team sizes `j` and update `dp[i][j]` accordingly. Finally, we will return the maximum value of `dp[N][j]` for all `j` such that `dp[N][j] <= M`.
