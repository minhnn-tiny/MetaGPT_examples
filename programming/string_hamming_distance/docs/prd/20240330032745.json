{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"Andrew likes strings very much.\nHe has two strings A and B of N lower alphabet letters. We denote S[i, j] as the substring from ith to jth characters of string S.\nAndrew is interested in the number of such fours of integers (LA, RA, LB, RB), where 1 ≤ LA ≤ RA ≤ N, 1 ≤ LB ≤ RB ≤ N, and RA − LA = RB − LB, such that the Hamming distance between substrings A[LA, RA] and B[LB, RB] is not greater than K. Here the Hamming distance between two strings of the same length is the number of unequal characters on the same positions of strings.\nHelp him and find this number.","Project Name":"string_hamming_distance","Product Goals":["Provide an efficient algorithm to calculate the number of fours (LA, RA, LB, RB) satisfying the given conditions.","Handle large input strings efficiently.","Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output."],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to be able to input two strings and a value for K.","As a user, I want to get the number of fours (LA, RA, LB, RB) satisfying the given conditions as output.","As a user, I want the program to be efficient and handle large input strings."],"Competitive Analysis":["String Hamming Distance Calculator A: Simple algorithm, but inefficient for large strings.","String Hamming Distance Calculator B: Efficient algorithm, but lacks a user-friendly interface.","String Hamming Distance Calculator C: Efficient algorithm and user-friendly interface, but limited to small input strings."],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements are clear and well-defined.
