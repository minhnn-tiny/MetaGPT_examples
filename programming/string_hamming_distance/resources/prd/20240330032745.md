## Original Requirements

Andrew likes strings very much.
He has two strings A and B of N lower alphabet letters. We denote S[i, j] as the substring from ith to jth characters of string S.
Andrew is interested in the number of such fours of integers (LA, RA, LB, RB), where 1 ≤ LA ≤ RA ≤ N, 1 ≤ LB ≤ RB ≤ N, and RA − LA = RB − LB, such that the Hamming distance between substrings A[LA, RA] and B[LB, RB] is not greater than K. Here the Hamming distance between two strings of the same length is the number of unequal characters on the same positions of strings.
Help him and find this number.

## Project Name

string_hamming_distance

## Product Goals

- Provide an efficient algorithm to calculate the number of fours (LA, RA, LB, RB) satisfying the given conditions.
- Handle large input strings efficiently.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to input two strings and a value for K.
- As a user, I want to get the number of fours (LA, RA, LB, RB) satisfying the given conditions as output.
- As a user, I want the program to be efficient and handle large input strings.

## Competitive Analysis

- String Hamming Distance Calculator A: Simple algorithm, but inefficient for large strings.
- String Hamming Distance Calculator B: Efficient algorithm, but lacks a user-friendly interface.
- String Hamming Distance Calculator C: Efficient algorithm and user-friendly interface, but limited to small input strings.

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements are clear and well-defined. The main challenge is to design an efficient algorithm that can handle large input strings. The algorithm should also be able to handle the case where the Hamming distance between the substrings is equal to K.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Design an efficient algorithm to calculate the number of fours (LA, RA, LB, RB) satisfying the given conditions.']
- ['P1', 'Handle large input strings efficiently.']
- ['P2', 'Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.']

## UI Design draft

The UI should be simple and easy to use. It should have fields for inputting the two strings and the value of K. The output should be displayed in a clear and concise manner.
