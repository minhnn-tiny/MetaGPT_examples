{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"It's autumn now, the time of the leaf fall.\nSergey likes to collect fallen leaves in autumn. In his city, he can find fallen leaves of maple, oak and poplar. These leaves can be of three different colors: green, yellow or red.\nSergey has collected some leaves of each type and color. Now he wants to create the biggest nice bouquet from them. He considers the bouquet nice iff all the leaves in it are either from the same type of tree or of the same color (or both). Moreover, he doesn't want to create a bouquet with even number of leaves in it, since this kind of bouquets are considered to attract bad luck. However, if it's impossible to make any nice bouquet, he won't do anything, thus, obtaining a bouquet with zero leaves.\nPlease help Sergey to find the maximal number of leaves he can have in a nice bouquet, which satisfies all the above mentioned requirements.\nPlease note that Sergey doesn't have to use all the leaves of the same color or of the same type. For example, if he has 20 maple leaves, he can still create a bouquet of 19 leaves.","Project Name":"autumn_leaves","Product Goals":["Help Sergey to find the maximal number of leaves he can have in a nice bouquet.","The bouquet should be either of the same type of tree or of the same color.","The bouquet should not have even number of leaves."],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to input the number of leaves of each type and color.","As a user, I want to get the maximal number of leaves in a nice bouquet."],"Competitive Analysis":[],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements are clear and concise.
