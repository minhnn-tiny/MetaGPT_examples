{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"All submissions for this problem are available. Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef holds all his secret recipes inside his house. For this reason, Chef wants to make his house secure. To do so, Chef wants to install guard towers in his house.\nUnfortunately, due to high costs, Chef can only activate 3 guard towers each night. Chef considers his house safe if the triangle formed by these 3 guard towers as vertices strictly contains his house. Chef's house is located at (0, 0).\nOn the ith day, Chef plans to install a guard tower at location (xi, yi). Chef wants to know how effective each installation is. Specifically, after every installation, Chef wants to know the number of subsets of 3 guard towers he can activate so that his house becomes safe. Please help him answer this question!\nThis is an online problem, so you won't get the next point unless you answer the question first. Don't forget to flush the output after every print statement. Please see the note section for details about how to flush the standard output.!\nInput\nThe first line of input contains a single integer N. The next N lines describe the points.\nThe ith line contains two integers xi and yi denoting the location of Chef's ith guard tower, (xi, yi).\nOutput\nOutput N lines. The ith line must contain a single integer, the answer to Chef's question after the ith installation.\nConstraints\n\n|xi|, |yi| ≤ 106\nThe points are distinct.\n(xi, yi) ≠ (0, 0)\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1: (11 points) 3 ≤ N ≤ 1000\nSubtask #2: (24 points) 3 ≤ N ≤ 12000\nSubtask #3: (65 points) 3 ≤ N ≤ 400000\n\nExample\nInput:\n6\n2 3\n3 2\n-1 -1\n3 3\n4 1\n5 5\n\n\nOutput:\n0\n0\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nExplanation\n\n\nAfter the first and second installations, there aren't enough guard towers for Chef to choose from.\nAfter the third and fourth installations, there is one set of guard towers that make Chef's house safe: {(2, 3), (3, 2), (-1, -1)}.\nAfter the fifth and sixth installations, there are two sets of guard towers that make Chef's house safe: {(2, 3), (3, 2), (-1, -1)} and {(2, 3), (4, 1), (-1, -1)}.\n\n\nNote\n\nYou can flush the standard output in C++ by writing fflush(stdout).\nIn Java, you can do that by System.out.flush(). Please read the documentations of a particular language for more details.","Project Name":"game_guard_tower","Product Goals":["Create a user-friendly interface","Provide a secure environment for Chef's recipes","Allow Chef to efficiently manage guard tower installations"],"User Stories":["As a Chef, I want to be able to install guard towers at specific locations.","As a Chef, I want to know how many subsets of 3 guard towers can be activated to protect my house.","As a Chef, I want to be able to view the locations of all installed guard towers.","As a Chef, I want to be able to remove guard towers that are no longer needed.","As a Chef, I want to be able to save and load the current guard tower configuration."],"Competitive Analysis":["Guard Tower Manager A: Simple interface, limited functionality","Guard Tower Manager B: More advanced features, but complex interface","Guard Tower Manager C: Similar functionality to our product, but lacks user-friendliness","Guard Tower Manager D: Open-source solution, but requires technical expertise to use","Guard Tower Manager E: Cloud-based solution, but may have security concerns"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements for this project are as follows:\n\n1. The system must allow Chef to install guard towers at specific locations.\n2. The system must calculate the number of subsets of 3 guard towers that can be activated to protect Chef's house.\n3. The system must allow Chef to view the locations of all installed guard towers.\n4. The system must allow Chef to remove guard towers that are no longer needed.\n5. The system must allow Chef to save and load the current guard tower configuration.\n\nIn addition to these functional requirements, the system must also meet the following non-functional requirements:\n\n1. The system must be user-friendly and easy to use.\n2. The system must be secure and protect Chef's recipes from unauthorized access.\n3. The system must be efficient and perform calculations quickly.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","The main code ..."],["P0","The game algorithm ..."]],"UI Design draft":"The UI design for this project will be simple and user-friendly. The main screen will display a map of Chef's house and the surrounding area. Guard towers will be represented by icons on the map. Chef will be able to click on the map to install or remove guard towers.\n\nA sidebar will display the number of subsets of 3 guard towers that can be activated to protect Chef's house. The sidebar will also contain buttons that allow Chef to save and load the current guard tower configuration.\n\nThe UI will be designed to be responsive and work well on all devices.","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
