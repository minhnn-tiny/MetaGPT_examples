{"Implementation approach":"We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will define a 2D array dp such that dp[i][j] represents the number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., i] that satisfy the given property and end with j. We can then use the following recurrence relation to compute dp[i][j]:\n\ndp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j+1]\n\nwhere dp[i-1][j-1] represents the number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., i-1] that satisfy the given property and end with j-1, and dp[i-1][j+1] represents the number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., i-1] that satisfy the given property and end with j+1.\n\nThe base cases for the recurrence relation are:\n\ndp[1][1] = 1\ndp[1][2] = 0\n\nWe can then use the recurrence relation to compute dp[i][j] for all i and j. The final answer is given by dp[N][N].","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Solution {\n        +count_permutations(n: int) int\n    }\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Main\n    participant Solution\n    Main->>Solution: count_permutations(n)\n    Solution-->>Main: return count\n","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
