## Original Requirements

Given N, count how many permutations of [1, 2, 3, ..., N] satisfy the following property.

Let P1, P2, ..., PN denote the permutation. The property we want to satisfy is that there exists an i between 2 and n-1 (inclusive) such that

Pj > Pj + 1  ∀    i ≤ j ≤ N - 1.
Pj > Pj - 1  ∀    2 ≤ j ≤ i.

## Project Name

permutation_count

## Product Goals

- Provide a way to count the number of permutations that satisfy the given property
- Make the solution efficient and scalable for large values of N
- Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to input a value of N and get the count of permutations that satisfy the given property
- As a user, I want the solution to be efficient and scalable for large values of N
- As a user, I want the interface to be user-friendly and easy to use

## Competitive Analysis

- There are no known competitive products that provide the same functionality as this project
- However, there are a number of products that provide similar functionality, such as permutation generators and combinatorics libraries
- These products typically do not focus on the specific property that this project addresses
