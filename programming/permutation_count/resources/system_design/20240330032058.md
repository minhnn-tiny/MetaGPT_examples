## Implementation approach

We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will define a 2D array dp such that dp[i][j] represents the number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., i] that satisfy the given property and end with j. We can then use the following recurrence relation to compute dp[i][j]:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j+1]

where dp[i-1][j-1] represents the number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., i-1] that satisfy the given property and end with j-1, and dp[i-1][j+1] represents the number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., i-1] that satisfy the given property and end with j+1.

The base cases for the recurrence relation are:

dp[1][1] = 1
dp[1][2] = 0

We can then use the recurrence relation to compute dp[i][j] for all i and j. The final answer is given by dp[N][N].
