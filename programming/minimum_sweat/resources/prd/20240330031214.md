Summers in Kharagpur are Hot. And Humid! It’s pretty rough for students who are new to KGP and are not used to the sweating it can cause.
The students want to minimize the amount of sweat while walking from their hostels to class. When they enter the sunshine, they begin sweating. The longer they stay in the sun, the more they sweat.
Precisely, if the Euclidean distance between points A and B is d, then a student sweats d2 units when going from A to B without stopping anywhere on the way. But if they stop at a shady spot on the way (like a tree), their continuous sun exposure is broken, and they stop sweating immediately! So they can sit in the shade of the tree and cool off before resuming their journey. Once they leave the shade, they start sweating again.
For example, if a student goes from his room A0 to class An+1 while stopping at n trees in between for shade, the total sweat produced is
d(A0,A1)2 + d(A1,A2)2 + …… + d(An,An+1)2
Your task is to help the students find a path from their rooms to class in such a way that they sweat the minimum.

## Project Name

minimum_sweat

## Product Goals

- Minimize the amount of sweat students produce while walking from their hostels to class
- Provide a user-friendly interface that is easy to use
- Be efficient and accurate in calculating the minimum sweat path

## User Stories

- As a student, I want to be able to enter the coordinates of my hostel and classroom
- As a student, I want to be able to see the minimum sweat path on a map
- As a student, I want to be able to save the minimum sweat path for future use

## Competitive Analysis

- **Product A:** This product is similar to ours in that it also helps students find the minimum sweat path from their hostels to class. However, our product is more user-friendly and efficient.
- **Product B:** This product is different from ours in that it does not provide a map of the minimum sweat path. Instead, it simply provides the coordinates of the minimum sweat path.
- **Product C:** This product is similar to ours in that it also provides a map of the minimum sweat path. However, our product is more accurate in calculating the minimum sweat path.

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements for this project are as follows:

* The product must be able to help students find the minimum sweat path from their hostels to class.
* The product must be user-friendly and easy to use.
* The product must be efficient and accurate in calculating the minimum sweat path.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'The product must be able to help students find the minimum sweat path from their hostels to class.']
- ['P1', 'The product must be user-friendly and easy to use.']
- ['P2', 'The product must be efficient and accurate in calculating the minimum sweat path.']

## UI Design draft

The UI for this product will be simple and easy to use. The user will be able to enter the coordinates of their hostel and classroom, and the product will then calculate the minimum sweat path. The user will be able to see the minimum sweat path on a map, and they will be able to save the minimum sweat path for future use.

## Anything UNCLEAR

There are no unclear aspects of this project.
