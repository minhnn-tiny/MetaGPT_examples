{"Implementation approach":"We will use a sliding window approach to count the number of substrings for each pair of integers. The sliding window will start at the first integer in the pair and will move to the right, one character at a time, until it reaches the second integer in the pair. At each position of the sliding window, we will count the number of substrings that start at that position and end at the current position of the sliding window. We will then add this count to the total count of substrings for the pair of integers.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Solution:\n        -s: str\n        -pairs: list[tuple[int, int]]\n        +__init__(s: str, pairs: list[tuple[int, int]])\n        +solve(self) -> list[int]\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Solution\n    Solution->>Solution: __init__(s, pairs)\n    Solution->>Solution: solve()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"None"}
