Also he has M pairs of integers Li, Ri (1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ N).For each pair Li, Ri, Chef writes out all distinct substrings of string S, which are started from positions Li, Li + 1, ..., Ri.Your task is to help Chef. That is, for each pair, find out how many substrings that he needs to write.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains non-empty string S and the second line contains positive integer M.Each of the next M lines contains a pair of integers Li, Ri.\n\nOutputFor each pair of each test case print the required number of substrings.Constraints\nString S contains only lowercase Latin letters.1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ N.Sum of all length's of S for test cases is not greater than 50000. Sum of all M values for test cases is not greater than 50000.\n\nExampleInput:\n2\nababa\n4\n1 1\n1 5\n5 5\n3 4\na\n1\n1 1\nOutput:\n5\n9\n1\n5\n1\n\n","Project Name":"substring_count","Product Goals":["Provide a way to count the number of substrings for each pair of integers","Handle multiple test cases efficiently","Ensure accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to be able to input a string and multiple pairs of integers","As a user, I want to see the count of substrings for each pair of integers","As a user, I want the program to handle multiple test cases correctly"],"Competitive Analysis":[],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements are clear and concise.
