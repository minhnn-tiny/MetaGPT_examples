Problem Statement
Chef has a string S = S1S2 ... SN, consisting of N lowercase Latin letters. Also he has M pairs of integers Li, Ri (1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ N).For each pair Li, Ri, Chef writes out all distinct substrings of string S, which are started from positions Li, Li + 1, ..., Ri.Your task is to help Chef. That is, for each pair, find out how many substrings that he needs to write.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains non-empty string S and the second line contains positive integer M.Each of the next M lines contains a pair of integers Li, Ri.

OutputFor each pair of each test case print the required number of substrings.Constraints
String S contains only lowercase Latin letters.1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ N.Sum of all length's of S for test cases is not greater than 50000. Sum of all M values for test cases is not greater than 50000.

## Project Name

substring_count

## Product Goals

- Provide a way to count the number of substrings for each pair of integers
- Handle multiple test cases efficiently
- Ensure accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to input a string and multiple pairs of integers
- As a user, I want to see the count of substrings for each pair of integers
- As a user, I want the program to handle multiple test cases correctly

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements are clear and concise. The program should take a string and multiple pairs of integers as input, and for each pair of integers, it should count the number of substrings of the string that start at the first integer and end at the second integer. The program should handle multiple test cases.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'The program should take a string and multiple pairs of integers as input.']
- ['P0', 'The program should count the number of substrings of the string that start at the first integer and end at the second integer for each pair of integers.']
- ['P0', 'The program should handle multiple test cases.']
