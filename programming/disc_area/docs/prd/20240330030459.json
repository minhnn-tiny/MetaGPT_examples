{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"All submissions for this problem are available.\nYou are given n discs on plane, of the same radius (r=1). Output the area of the part of the plane which is covered by each disc.\nInput\nFirst, 1<=t<=10, the number of tests. Each testcase is of the following form: 1<=n<=100000, then n pairs of floating point coordinates follow: -1000<=xi,yi<=1000, representing the location of the i-th disc.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, output the total area covered by the intersection of all discs. Round the answer to 6 decimal digits after the point.\nExample\nInput:\n1\n2\n0 0\n0 1\n\nOutput:\n1.228370","Project Name":"disc_area","Product Goals":["Calculate the area covered by discs","Handle multiple test cases","Round the answer to 6 decimal digits"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to input the number of discs and their coordinates","As a user, I want to get the total area covered by the discs"],"Competitive Analysis":[],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements are clear and concise. The project involves calculating the area covered by discs on a plane. The input consists of the number of discs and their coordinates. The output is the total area covered by the discs, rounded to 6 decimal digits. The project requires basic knowledge of geometry and programming.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Calculate the area covered by a single disc"],["P0","Calculate the area covered by multiple discs"],["P0","Round the answer to 6 decimal digits"]],"UI Design draft":"N/A","Anything UNCLEAR":"None"}
