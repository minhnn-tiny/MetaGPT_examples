## Original Requirements

All submissions for this problem are available.
A number X is called Permut number if X and 2X ( both without leading zeroes ) have same number of digits and are permutations of each other. Given A and B, find the number of Permut numbers >= A and <= B.

Note : X is called permutation of Y if every digit ( 0 - 9 ) occurs same number of times in both the numbers ( maybe at different positions ).

Input :

The first line contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow, containing two integers A and B.

Output :

Output T lines, one for each test case containing the desired answer for the corresponding test case.

Sample Input :
2
1 100
499875921 499875921

Sample Output :
0
1

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10000
1 <= A <= B <= 10000000000 (10^10)




## Project Name

permut_number

## Product Goals

- Create a program that finds the number of Permut numbers >= A and <= B.
- Ensure the program is efficient and accurate.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to input two integers, A and B.
- As a user, I want the program to find the number of Permut numbers >= A and <= B.
- As a user, I want the program to display the result.

## Competitive Analysis

- There are no known competitive products that perform the same function as this program.

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements are clear and concise. The program should be able to find the number of Permut numbers >= A and <= B. The program should be efficient and accurate. The program should provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'The program should be able to find the number of Permut numbers >= A and <= B.']
- ['P1', 'The program should be efficient and accurate.']
- ['P2', 'The program should provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.']

## UI Design draft

The program will have a simple command-line interface. The user will be prompted to enter two integers, A and B. The program will then find the number of Permut numbers >= A and <= B and display the result.
