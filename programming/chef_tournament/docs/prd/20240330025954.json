{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"All submissions for this problem are available.\nChef is planning a grand cooking tournament for aspiring chefs in the region.\nThe competition progresses with a number of one-on-one elimination rounds until only one chef remains.\nFor each round, two chefs are chosen at random for a cook-off.\nThe loser of the cook-off is elimited, while the winner moves on.\nAdditionally, each chef begins with a positive number of prize tokens\n(some chefs begin with more than others, based on their performance in a qualification round).\nThe winner of each cook-off receives all of the loser's prize tokens, and the loser is\nawarded a prize based on the number of prize tokens he/she had accrued.\nThe final cook-off always receives the most publicity.\nYour task it to compute the expected difference between the number of prize tokens of the final two\ncompetitors before the final cook-off.\nYou will be given the number of tokens each chef begins with.\nInput\nInput begins with an integer T, the number of test cases (at most 50).\nEach test case consists of a single line, beginning with an integer C,\nthe number of chefs in the competition, followed by C positive integers each describing the number\nof prize tokens a chef begins with.\nThe total number of prize tokens among all chefs will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the expected difference in prize tokens, rounded to 6 places\nafter the decimal point.\nSample Input\n3\n3 1 1 1\n3 1 1 2\n4 10 10 10 30\nSample Output\n1.000000\n1.333333\n26.666667\n","Project Name":"chef_tournament","Product Goals":["Provide an accurate estimate of the expected difference in prize tokens between the final two competitors.","Handle a variety of input scenarios with varying numbers of chefs and prize tokens.","Deliver results efficiently and within a reasonable time frame."],"User Stories":["As a tournament organizer, I want to know the expected difference in prize tokens between the final two competitors before the final cook-off.","As a chef, I want to understand how my starting number of prize tokens affects my chances of reaching the final cook-off.","As a spectator, I want to be able to follow the progress of the tournament and see how the expected difference in prize tokens changes as the competition progresses."],"Competitive Analysis":["**Chef Duel Simulator**\n- Simulates one-on-one cook-offs and tracks the number of prize tokens each chef has.\n- Does not account for the random selection of chefs for each cook-off.\n- Does not provide an estimate of the expected difference in prize tokens between the final two competitors.","**Tournament Analyzer**\n- Analyzes tournament data and provides insights into the performance of individual chefs.\n- Does not simulate the tournament process or account for the random selection of chefs for each cook-off.\n- Does not provide an estimate of the expected difference in prize tokens between the final two competitors.","**Chef Wars**\n- A game that simulates a cooking tournament with multiple rounds.\n- Does not provide an estimate of the expected difference in prize tokens between the final two competitors.\n- Focuses on gameplay rather than providing analytical insights."],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements for this project are relatively straightforward. We need to be able to:\n\n1. Read the input data, which consists of the number of chefs and the number of prize tokens each chef has.\n2. Simulate the tournament process, randomly selecting two chefs for each cook-off and updating the number of prize tokens each chef has.\n3. Calculate the expected difference in prize tokens between the final two competitors.\n\nThe main challenge in this project is ensuring that the simulation is accurate and efficient. We need to make sure that the random selection of chefs for each cook-off is truly random and that the simulation runs quickly enough to be practical.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Read the input data."],["P0","Simulate the tournament process."],["P0","Calculate the expected difference in prize tokens between the final two competitors."]],"UI Design draft":"The user interface for this project will be simple and straightforward. The user will be able to input the number of chefs and the number of prize tokens each chef has. The program will then simulate the tournament process and display the expected difference in prize tokens between the final two competitors.","Anything UNCLEAR":"There are no unclear aspects of the project requirements."}
