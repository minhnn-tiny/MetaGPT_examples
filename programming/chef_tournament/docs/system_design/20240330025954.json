{"Implementation approach":"We will use a simulation approach to solve this problem. We will simulate the tournament process by randomly selecting two chefs for each cook-off and updating the number of prize tokens each chef has. We will repeat this process until only two chefs remain. We will then calculate the expected difference in prize tokens between the final two competitors.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Chef:\n        - name: str\n        - prize_tokens: int\n        +__init__(name: str, prize_tokens: int)\n        +get_name() str\n        +get_prize_tokens() int\n        +set_prize_tokens(prize_tokens: int)\n    class Tournament:\n        - chefs: List[Chef]\n        +__init__(chefs: List[Chef])\n        +simulate() List[Chef]\n        +get_expected_difference() float\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Main\n    participant Tournament\n    participant Chef\n    Main->>Tournament: __init__(chefs)\n    Tournament->>Chef: __init__(name, prize_tokens)\n    Tournament->>Tournament: simulate()\n    Tournament->>Chef: get_prize_tokens()\n    Tournament->>Tournament: get_expected_difference()\n    Tournament-->>Main: return expected_difference\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"None"}
