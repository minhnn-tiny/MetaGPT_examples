## Original Requirements

All submissions for this problem are available.
In the magic land, there is a smart but naughty boy Crane.
Crane has n houses, and n friends (both numbered from 1 to n).
Crane's mother has scheduled a plan for all his friends
such that each friend visits each house of Crane exactly once
at a different time, i.e.,
there is at most one friend in any house at any time.
But like Crane all his friends are also naughty.
Therefore his mother wants to lock away each of his friends in distinct houses.
What she'll do is to choose a distinct house for each friend. As that friend visits
that house, he'll be locked in that house.  That is, Crane's mother wants to find a
sequence block such that
the i-th friend will be locked in block[i]-th house
once he visits that house. As she wants to ensure that there is at maximum one
person in each house, she must choose the sequence block such
that if friend A visits house H at time T, and he is locked away in the house, then no other friends visit house H
after time T. 
Help Crane's mother to find such a sequence block. 
Input
First line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n
≤ 100), indicating the number of friends and houses.
Then n lines follow, with each line containing n positive integers.
The j-th integer in i-th line indicates the time when the i-th friend will visit the j-th house. All times will fit in signed 32-bit integer.
Output
If there exists a sequence block that satisfies the constraints, then output block[1] block[2] ... block[n] in one line, separated by a single space.
Otherwise if there is no such sequence, output -1 in one line.
If there are multiple answers, then anyone will do.
Example

Input:
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Output:
3 2 1




## Project Name

lock_friends

## Product Goals

- Help Crane's mother find a sequence block that satisfies the constraints.
- Output the sequence block if it exists, or -1 if it does not.
- Handle multiple answers by outputting any one of them.

## User Stories

- As Crane's mother, I want to find a sequence block that satisfies the constraints so that I can lock away each of my son's friends in distinct houses.
- As a user, I want the program to output the sequence block if it exists, or -1 if it does not.
- As a user, I want the program to handle multiple answers by outputting any one of them.

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements are clear and concise. The program should take as input the number of friends and houses, and the times at which each friend will visit each house. It should then output a sequence block that satisfies the constraints, or -1 if no such sequence block exists.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'The program should take as input the number of friends and houses, and the times at which each friend will visit each house.']
- ['P0', 'The program should output a sequence block that satisfies the constraints, or -1 if no such sequence block exists.']
- ['P1', 'The program should handle multiple answers by outputting any one of them.']
