{"Implementation approach":"We will use a greedy approach to find the sequence block. We will start by sorting the friends in ascending order of the time they will visit the first house. Then, we will iterate over the friends in this order, and for each friend, we will find the house that has the earliest time that the friend has not yet visited. We will then assign the friend to that house and update the earliest time for that house. If there is no house that the friend has not yet visited, then we will output -1 to indicate that there is no valid sequence block.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Solution:\n        -friends: list[int]\n        -houses: list[int]\n        -times: list[list[int]]\n        +__init__(friends: list[int], houses: list[int], times: list[list[int]])\n        +solve() list[int]\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Solution\n    Solution->>Solution: __init__(friends, houses, times)\n    Solution->>Solution: solve()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"None."}
