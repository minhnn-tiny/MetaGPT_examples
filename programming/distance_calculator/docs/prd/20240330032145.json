{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"With the impressive achievement in competitive programming Jem was offered an internship at IBER - a tech company that provides an alternative to tradditional taxi service.\n\nJem first task was help IBER quickly calculate the distance between two arbitrary locations in Jem's city. As an experienced competitive programmer Jem understand that this is not a trivial problem with general graph. Fortunately after investigate the city map Jem found out that the roads system is have a special form which may make Jem's problem easier to deal with.\n\nThere are N locations in the city and M bidirectional road connecting them. Each road i have the length of Ci and no two road connect the same pair of locations. The roads system is designed in a way that from a specific location one can travel to any other locations. The most important point is that there is no location belong to more than one cycle in the graph corresponding to road network.\n\nSo Jem already got his solution. If you want to secure an internship at IBER maybe you can try to solve this problem too!","Project Name":"distance_calculator","Product Goals":["Quickly calculate the distance between two arbitrary locations in Jem's city","Handle the special form of the roads system","Provide an efficient and accurate solution"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to be able to input the number of locations and roads","As a user, I want to be able to input the length of each road","As a user, I want to be able to input the number of queries","As a user, I want to be able to input the two locations for each query","As a user, I want to be able to get the shortest distance between the two locations for each query"],"Competitive Analysis":[],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements are clear and concise. The problem is well-defined and the solution is feasible. The requirements can be divided into the following subtasks:\n\n1. Read the input data\n2. Build the graph\n3.
