## Implementation approach

We will use a custom data structure to store the set. This data structure will be efficient for both adding and erasing elements, and it will also allow us to find the sum of all elements in the set in O(1) time.

## File list

- main.cpp
- set.h
- set.cpp

## Data structures and interfaces


classDiagram
    class Main {
        -set set
        +main() int
    }
    class Set {
        -vector<int> elements
        +Set()
        +add(element: int)
        +erase(element: int)
        +sum() int
    }
    Main --> Set


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant S as Set
    M->>S: Set()
    loop for each operation
        M->>S: add(element) or erase(element)
    end
    M->>S: sum()
    S-->>M: return sum
    M-->>S: destroy()


## Anything UNCLEAR

None.
