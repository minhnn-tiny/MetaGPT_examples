Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nAs part of his daily job, Chef has to solve problems involving sets. Till now, Chef has been using inefficient methods to solve his set related problem, wasting a lot of his precious time. He has agreed to pay you a lot of money for solving the following problem for him efficiently.\n\nFirst, Chef needs to perform Q operations on a set. Each operation is either:\n\n1. Add a number to the set (if this number is NOT already present in the set).\n2. Erase a number from the set (if this number exists in the set).\n\nThen, he needs to find the sum of all elements of the set after performing these Q queries. Your job is to find this sum for him quickly.","Project Name":"set_operations","Product Goals":["Solve the problem efficiently","Handle a large number of operations","Provide a clear and concise solution"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to be able to add and erase numbers from a set","As a user, I want to be able to find the sum of all elements in the set","As a user, I want the solution to be efficient and handle a large number of operations"],"Competitive Analysis":["set_operations_solution_A: Uses a built-in set data structure, which may not be efficient for large inputs","set_operations_solution_B: Uses a custom data structure to handle large inputs efficiently","set_operations_solution_C: Uses a combination of techniques to optimize performance"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Efficiency and Scalability of Set Operations Solutions\"\n    x-axis \"Low Efficiency\" --> \"High Efficiency\"\n    y-axis \"Low Scalability\" --> \"High Scalability\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Solution A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Solution B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Solution C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements are clear and concise. The problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Read the input and initialize the set.\n2. Perform the operations on the set.\n3. Find the sum of all elements in the set.\n\nThe main challenge is to find an efficient way to perform the operations on the set. A custom data structure can be used to achieve this.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Read the input and initialize the set."],["P0","Perform the operations on the set."],["P0","Find the sum of all elements in the set."]],"UI Design draft":"N/A","Anything UNCLEAR":"There are no unclear aspects of the requirements."}
