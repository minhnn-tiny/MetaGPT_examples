{"Implementation approach":"We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will define a 2D array dp such that dp[i][j] represents the number of nice sequences of length i that end with the number j. We can then use the following recurrence relation to compute the values of dp:\n\ndp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k]) for k in range(j-D, j+1)\n\nwhere dp[i-1][k] represents the number of nice sequences of length i-1 that end with the number k. We can then compute the answer to the problem as the sum of dp[K][j] for all j in range(1, N+1).\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(N*K*D), which is efficient enough to solve the problem within the given time limit.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Solution {\n        -N: int\n        -K: int\n        -D: int\n        -dp: list[list[int]]\n        +__init__(N: int, K: int, D: int)\n        +solve() int\n    }\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Solution\n    Solution->>Solution: __init__(N, K, D)\n    Solution->>Solution: solve()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"None"}
