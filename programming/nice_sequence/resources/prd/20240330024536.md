## Original Requirements

All submissions for this problem are available. Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Consider the sequence of K natural numbers: a1, a2, ..., aK. Tooru thinks that this sequence is nice if and only if:
a1+a2+...+aK = N
a1 < a2 < ... < aK
ai+1 - ai <= D for every natural i, smaller than K
a1 <= D

You are given N, K and D. Please, count the number of nice sequences for her. This number can be huge, so we ask you to output it modulo 109+7.

Input
The first and only line of the input consists of the integers N, K and D, separated by a single space.
Output
Output the number of nice sequences on the first line of the output modulo 109+7.
Example
Input:
10 4 1

Output:
1
Explanation
The only suitable sequence is (1, 2, 3, 4).

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements are clear and well-defined.

The problem can be broken down into the following subtasks:

1. Read the input values N, K, and D.
2. Determine if there are any valid sequences for the given input.
3. Count the number of valid sequences.
4. Output the count modulo 109+7.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Read the input values N, K, and D.']
- ['P0', 'Determine if there are any valid sequences for the given input.']
- ['P0', 'Count the number of valid sequences.']
- ['P0', 'Output the count modulo 109+7.']
