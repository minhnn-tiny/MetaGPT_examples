## Implementation approach

We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will define a 2D array dp such that dp[i][j] represents the number of nice sequences of length i that end with the number j. We can then use the following recurrence relation to compute the values of dp:

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k]) for k in range(j-D, j+1)

where dp[i-1][k] represents the number of nice sequences of length i-1 that end with the number k. We can then compute the answer to the problem as the sum of dp[K][j] for all j in range(1, N+1).

This approach has a time complexity of O(N*K*D), which is efficient enough to solve the problem within the given time limit.
