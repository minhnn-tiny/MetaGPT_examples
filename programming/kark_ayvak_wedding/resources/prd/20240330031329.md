Today is the planned day tor Thik and Ayvak's wedding. Kark is infatuated with Ayvak. He offers to play a game with Thik. Whosoever wins, will get to marry Ayvak. Ayvak, who values games of chance over all the other things in life, agrees to this.

Kark sets up an N by M grid (N rows, M columns), labelled from left to right and top to bottom consecutively with numbers from 1 to M*N, with 1 at the top left corner and M*N at the bottom right corner. For example, a labelled 3 by 6 grid looks as follows:



Kark has already painted K unit squares of the grid with a heart each. Next, Thik randomly picks a rectangle with sides on the grid lines, and having a positive area, with each valid rectangle having an equal probability of being chosen. Three distinct possibilities for Thik's rectangle in the 3 by 6 grid are shown below: 



The nine different rectangles in a 2 by 2 grid are shown below:




If Thik's rectangle contains at least half of the hearts, Thik gets to marry Ayvak. Otherwise, Kark will marry Ayvak. Kark wants to know whether or not he has an advantage here, so he wants to know the expected value of the number of hearts a randomly chosen rectangle will cover. I'm sure that you have a good heart, so please, cover this job for him. 

Input
The first line of input contains one integer T, the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains 3 space-separated integers N, M, K, as described in the problem statement. The next line contains K space-separated integers, each a single number from 1 to M*N, representing a square that is painted with a heart. It is guaranteed that all K integers are distinct.
Output
Output T lines, each containing a single real number, containing the expected number of hearts that a randomly chosen rectangle will contain. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 10-6.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 5  
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 107  
1 ≤ K ≤ 105 
Each of the K integers representing a heart are between 1 and N*M, inclusive. All K integers are distinct. 
Subtasks
Subtask 1 (15 points) : 

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10
1 ≤ K ≤ N * M 

Subtask 2 (85 points) : no additional constraints 


Example
Input:

## Project Name

kark_ayvak_wedding

## Product Goals

- Provide a fair game for both Kark and Thik
- Calculate the expected number of hearts in a randomly chosen rectangle efficiently
- Handle various test cases with different grid sizes and heart placements

## User Stories

- As Kark, I want to know the expected number of hearts in a randomly chosen rectangle to assess my chances of marrying Ayvak.
- As Thik, I want to understand the probability of getting at least half of the hearts to increase my chances of marrying Ayvak.
- As a user, I want to see the results for different grid sizes and heart placements to analyze the impact of these factors on the expected number of hearts.

## Competitive Analysis

- Heart Match: A similar game that involves matching hearts on a grid, but with different rules and no probabilistic calculations.
- Grid Hearts: A game that involves placing hearts on a grid, but without the random rectangle selection and expected value calculation.
- Probability Calculator: A tool that can calculate probabilities for various scenarios, but not specifically tailored to this game.

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements are clear and well-defined. The game rules are straightforward, and the expected value calculation is based on sound mathematical principles. The constraints on the input values ensure that the problem is well-posed and solvable.

The requirements can be broken down into the following subtasks:

1. Read the input, including the number of test cases, grid size, and heart placements.
2. For each test case, calculate the expected number of hearts in a randomly chosen rectangle.
3. Output the expected number of hearts for each test case.

The expected number of hearts can be calculated using the following formula:

```
E(X) = sum(p_i * x_i)
```

where:

* E(X) is the expected number of hearts
* p_i is the probability of choosing rectangle i
* x_i is the number of hearts in rectangle i

The probability of choosing a particular rectangle is equal to the area of that rectangle divided by the total area of all possible rectangles. The number of hearts in a rectangle can be determined by counting the number of hearts that fall within the rectangle's boundaries.

By summing the products of probabilities and heart counts for all possible rectangles, we can obtain the expected number of hearts.
