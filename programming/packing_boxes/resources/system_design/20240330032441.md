## Implementation approach

We will use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will define a function `dp(i)` that represents the minimum cost of packing the first `i` boxes. We can compute `dp(i)` as follows:

```python
dp(i) = min(dp(j) + dp(i - j) + a[j] + a[i - j]) for j in range(1, i // 2 + 1)
```

where `a` is the list of box sizes. This equation represents the cost of packing the first `i` boxes by splitting them into two groups of sizes `j` and `i - j`, and then packing each group separately.

Once we have computed `dp(i)` for all `i`, we can find the minimum cost of packing all the boxes as `dp(n)`, where `n` is the total number of boxes.

## Data structures and interfaces

```python
class Box:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size

class Solution:
    def __init__(self, boxes):
        self.boxes = boxes
        self.dp = [0] * (len(boxes) + 1)

    def solve(self):
        for i in range(1, len(self.boxes) + 1):
            self.dp[i] = min(self.dp[j] + self.dp[i - j] + self.boxes[j].size + self.boxes[i - j].size for j in range(1, i // 2 + 1))

        return self.dp[len(self.boxes)]
```

## Program call flow

```python
boxes = [Box(int(input())) for _ in range(int(input()))]
solution = Solution(boxes)
result = solution.solve()
print(result)
```
