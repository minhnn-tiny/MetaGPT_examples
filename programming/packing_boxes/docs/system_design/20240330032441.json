{"Implementation approach":"We will use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will define a function `dp(i)` that represents the minimum cost of packing the first `i` boxes. We can compute `dp(i)` as follows:\n\n```python\ndp(i) = min(dp(j) + dp(i - j) + a[j] + a[i - j]) for j in range(1, i // 2 + 1)\n```\n\nwhere `a` is the list of box sizes. This equation represents the cost of packing the first `i` boxes by splitting them into two groups of sizes `j` and `i - j`, and then packing each group separately.\n\nOnce we have computed `dp(i)` for all `i`, we can find the minimum cost of packing all the boxes as `dp(n)`, where `n` is the total number of boxes.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"```python\nclass Box:\n    def __init__(self, size):\n        self.size = size\n\nclass Solution:\n    def __init__(self, boxes):\n        self.boxes = boxes\n        self.dp = [0] * (len(boxes) + 1)\n\n    def solve(self):\n        for i in range(1, len(self.boxes) + 1):\n            self.dp[i] = min(self.dp[j] + self.dp[i - j] + self.boxes[j].size + self.boxes[i - j].size for j in range(1, i // 2 + 1))\n\n        return self.dp[len(self.boxes)]\n```","Program call flow":"```python\nboxes = [Box(int(input())) for _ in range(int(input()))]\nsolution = Solution(boxes)\nresult = solution.solve()\nprint(result)\n```","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
