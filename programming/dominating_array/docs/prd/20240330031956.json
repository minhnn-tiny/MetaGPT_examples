{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"Chef likes arrays and anything related to it. He call an array V dominating if there exists a number x (the dominator) whose number of occurrences in V  strictly greater than half the size of the array (that is, floor(|V|/2)).\n\nHis friend Dmytro wants to make Chef happy, so he presented this interesting problem for Chef.\nGiven an array A. You have to process Q queries on it. Queries can be one of two types:\n\n 1 x y  - Assign value y to x-th element in array A, i.e. Ax = y.\n2 l r  - print \"Yes\" if subarray A[l..r] is dominating, \"No\" otherwise","Project Name":"dominating_array","Product Goals":["Provide an efficient solution to the problem","Handle queries quickly and accurately","Provide a user-friendly interface"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to be able to input an array and a series of queries","As a user, I want to receive accurate results for each query","As a user, I want to be able to easily understand the output"],"Competitive Analysis":["Dominating Array Solver A: Command-line tool with limited functionality","Dominating Array Solver B: Web-based tool with a user-friendly interface but slow performance","Dominating Array Solver C: Mobile app with a sleek design but limited features"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements are clear and concise. The problem is well-defined and the solution is straightforward. The main challenge is to implement the solution efficiently and handle the queries quickly and accurately.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Implement the algorithm to find the dominating element in an array"],["P1","Handle queries efficiently"],["P2","Provide a user-friendly interface"]],"UI Design draft":"The UI should be simple and easy to use. The user should be able to input the array and queries easily, and the output should be clear and concise.","Anything UNCLEAR":"There are no unclear aspects of the project."}
