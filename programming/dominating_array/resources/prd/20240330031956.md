## Original Requirements

Chef likes arrays and anything related to it. He call an array V dominating if there exists a number x (the dominator) whose number of occurrences in V  strictly greater than half the size of the array (that is, floor(|V|/2)).

His friend Dmytro wants to make Chef happy, so he presented this interesting problem for Chef.
Given an array A. You have to process Q queries on it. Queries can be one of two types:

 1 x y  - Assign value y to x-th element in array A, i.e. Ax = y.
2 l r  - print "Yes" if subarray A[l..r] is dominating, "No" otherwise

## Project Name

dominating_array

## Product Goals

- Provide an efficient solution to the problem
- Handle queries quickly and accurately
- Provide a user-friendly interface

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to input an array and a series of queries
- As a user, I want to receive accurate results for each query
- As a user, I want to be able to easily understand the output

## Competitive Analysis

- Dominating Array Solver A: Command-line tool with limited functionality
- Dominating Array Solver B: Web-based tool with a user-friendly interface but slow performance
- Dominating Array Solver C: Mobile app with a sleek design but limited features

    "Our Target Product": [0.5, 0.6]

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements are clear and concise. The problem is well-defined and the solution is straightforward. The main challenge is to implement the solution efficiently and handle the queries quickly and accurately.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement the algorithm to find the dominating element in an array']
- ['P1', 'Handle queries efficiently']
- ['P2', 'Provide a user-friendly interface']

## UI Design draft

The UI should be simple and easy to use. The user should be able to input the array and queries easily, and the output should be clear and concise.

## Anything UNCLEAR

There are no unclear aspects of the project.
