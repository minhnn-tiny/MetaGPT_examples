## Implementation approach

We will use a hash map to store the frequency of each element in the array. Then, we will iterate over the array and find the element with the maximum frequency. If the maximum frequency is greater than half the size of the array, then the array is dominating.

## Data structures and interfaces


class Solution:
    def isDominating(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        freq = {}  # key: element, value: frequency
        for el in arr:
            if el not in freq:
                freq[el] = 0
            freq[el] += 1
        max_freq = 0
        max_el = None
        for el, freq in freq.items():
            if freq > max_freq:
                max_freq = freq
                max_el = el
        return max_freq > len(arr) // 2
