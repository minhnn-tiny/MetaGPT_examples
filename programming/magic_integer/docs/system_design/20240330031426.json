{"Implementation approach":"We will use a greedy approach to solve this problem. We will iterate over the array of numbers and for each number, we will calculate the k-th digit of MagicInteger(l,v) for each request. If the length of MagicInteger(l,v) is smaller than k, we will output \"So sad\" without quotes.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        -nums: list[int]\n        -requests: list[tuple[int, int, int]]\n        +__init__(nums: list[int], requests: list[tuple[int, int, int]])\n        +solve()\n    }\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    M->>M: __init__(nums, requests)\n    M->>M: solve()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"None"}
