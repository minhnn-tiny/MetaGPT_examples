{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"All submissions for this problem are available. \nChef studied science at school. But now he was tired of it. He likes to solve problems on Codechef. Here and now, he decided to go to his favourite site and solve several interesting problems. But as it turned out Chef is not yet ready to solve the harder problems. So you have to help him.\n\nIf you take away all the foreword, then the task set is this: you have N non-negative numbers A1, A2 ... AN and M requests. MagicInteger(l,v) is equal to concatenation of the numbers Ai, such that (i = l + v * q & 1 <= i <= n & q >= 0). For each such request you have to write the k-th digit of MagicInteger(l,v).\n\nConcatanation example:\nIf you have 2 numbers 11, 22 - after concatenation you will have 1122.\nIf you have 3 number 13, 44, 12 - after concatenation you will have 134412.\nOne more example: 0, 3, 11, 0 - after concatenation you will have 03110. First digit of this string is 0, not 3.\n\n \nInput\nThe first line contains an integer N denoting the number of integers in the given array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the given array. The third line has a single integer M denoting the number of requests. The next M lines contains three space separated numbers in each line (l, v, k) denoting each request. \nOutput\nFor each request output a single line containing k-th digit of MagicInteger(l, v). If the length of MagicInteger(l,v) is smaller than k, you need to output \"So sad\" without quotes.\nConstraints\n\n1 ≤ N ≤ 105\n1 ≤ M ≤ 105\n0 ≤ Ai ≤ 109\n1 ≤ l, v ≤ 105\n1 ≤ k ≤ 106\n\n \nExample\nInput:\n4\n0 1 2 3\n5\n1 1 2\n1 2 2\n1 2 1\n2 2 3\n4 100000 1\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n0\nSo sad\n3\n \nScoring\nSubtask 1 (30 points): N ≤ 1000\nSubtask 2 (25 points): V ≤ 100\nSubtask 3 (45 points):  Look at constraints  ","Project Name":"magic_integer","Product Goals":["Help Chef solve problems on Codechef","Provide a way to calculate the k-th digit of MagicInteger(l,v)","Handle large inputs efficiently"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to be able to input an array of non-negative integers.","As a user, I want to be able to input a series of requests, each consisting of three integers (l, v, k).","As a user, I want to receive the k-th digit of MagicInteger(l,v) for each request."],"Competitive Analysis":[],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"","Requirement Analysis":"The requirements are clear and concise.
