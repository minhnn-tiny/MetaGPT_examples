## Implementation approach

We will use a brute-force approach to solve this problem. We will generate all possible combinations of K letters that can be inserted into the password, and then check if the resulting string is equal to the original password. If it is, then we know that we have found the correct combination of letters that were inserted. We will then count the number of unsuccessful attempts that we made before finding the correct combination, and output this number modulo 1009419529.

class PasswordRecovery:
    def __init__(self, password, k):
        self.password = password
        self.k = k

    def generate_combinations(self):
        combinations = []
        for i in range(len(self.password) + 1):
            for j in range(self.k + 1):
                combination = self.password[:i] + ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase, k=j)) + self.password[i:]
                combinations.append(combination)
        return combinations

    def find_correct_combination(self):
        combinations = self.generate_combinations()
        for combination in combinations:
            if combination == self.password:
                return combination
        return None

    def count_unsuccessful_attempts(self):
        correct_combination = self.find_correct_combination()
        if correct_combination is None:
            return -1
        return len(combinations) - 1
