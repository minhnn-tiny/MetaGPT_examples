{"Implementation approach":"We will use a brute-force approach to solve this problem. We will generate all possible combinations of K letters that can be inserted into the password, and then check if the resulting string is equal to the original password. If it is, then we know that we have found the correct combination of letters that were inserted. We will then count the number of unsuccessful attempts that we made before finding the correct combination, and output this number modulo 1009419529.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"```python\nclass PasswordRecovery:\n    def __init__(self, password, k):\n        self.password = password\n        self.k = k\n\n    def generate_combinations(self):\n        combinations = []\n        for i in range(len(self.password) + 1):\n            for j in range(self.k + 1):\n                combination = self.password[:i] + ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase, k=j)) + self.password[i:]\n                combinations.append(combination)\n        return combinations\n\n    def find_correct_combination(self):\n        combinations = self.generate_combinations()\n        for combination in combinations:\n            if combination == self.password:\n                return combination\n        return None\n\n    def count_unsuccessful_attempts(self):\n        correct_combination = self.find_correct_combination()\n        if correct_combination is None:\n            return -1\n        return len(combinations) - 1\n```","Program call flow":"```sequenceDiagram\nparticipant Main\nparticipant PasswordRecovery\nMain->>PasswordRecovery: __init__(password, k)\nPasswordRecovery->>PasswordRecovery: generate_combinations()\nPasswordRecovery->>PasswordRecovery: find_correct_combination()\nPasswordRecovery->>PasswordRecovery: count_unsuccessful_attempts()\nMain->>PasswordRecovery: get_unsuccessful_attempts()\n```","Anything UNCLEAR":"None"}
