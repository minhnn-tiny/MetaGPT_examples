{"Implementation approach":"We will use a bottom-up approach to calculate the maximum path value of the complete binary tree. We will start by calculating the maximum path value of the leaf nodes. Then, we will calculate the maximum path value of the internal nodes by considering the maximum path values of their left and right children. Finally, we will return the maximum path value of the root node.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Node {\n        -value: int\n        -left: Node\n        -right: Node\n        +__init__(value: int)\n        +get_max_path_value() int\n    }\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Node\n    Node->>Node: __init__(value)\n    Node->>Node: get_max_path_value()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
