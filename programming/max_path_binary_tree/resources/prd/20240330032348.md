## Original Requirements

Given a complete binary tree with the height of H, we index the nodes respectively top-down and left-right from 1. The i-th node stores a positive integer Vi. Define Pi as follows: Pi=Vi if the i-th node is a leaf, otherwise Pi=max(Vi*PL, Vi*PR), where L and R are the indices of the left and right children of i, respectively. Your task is to caculate the value of P1.
