    "Implementation approach": "We will use the Rust programming language and the Solana platform to create a secure and transparent tic-tac-toe smart contract. The game's user interface will be built using the Rust programming language and the Iced library, which provides a simple and easy-to-use API for creating graphical user interfaces. The smart contract will be deployed to the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework, which provides a high-level API for creating and interacting with smart contracts.",
