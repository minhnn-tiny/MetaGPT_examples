## Implementation approach

We will use the Rust programming language and the Solana platform to create a secure and transparent tic-tac-toe smart contract. The game's user interface will be built using the Rust programming language and the Iced library, which provides a simple and easy-to-use API for creating graphical user interfaces. The smart contract will be deployed to the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework, which provides a high-level API for creating and interacting with smart contracts.

## Data structures and interfaces

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game {
        - board: [[u8; 3]; 3]
        - current_player: u8
        - winner: Option<u8>
        +new() Game
        +make_move(x: usize, y: usize) bool
        +check_winner() Option<u8>
    }
    class SmartContract {
        - game: Game
        +initialize() bool
        +make_move(x: usize, y: usize) bool
        +get_game_state() Game
    }
    class UI {
        - game: Game
        +render() void
        +handle_input(input: String) bool
    }
    Game --> SmartContract
    SmartContract --> UI
```

## Program call flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant G as Game
    participant SC as SmartContract
    participant UI as UI
    UI->>SC: get_game_state()
    SC->>G: get_game_state()
    G-->>SC: return game_state
    SC-->>UI: return game_state
    UI->>G: make_move(x, y)
    G->>SC: make_move(x, y)
    SC-->>G: return move_result
    G-->>UI: return move_result
    UI->>SC: initialize()
    SC->>G: initialize()
    G-->>SC: return init_result
    SC-->>UI: return init_result
```

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific rules of the tic-tac-toe game, such as whether draws are allowed and how ties are handled.
