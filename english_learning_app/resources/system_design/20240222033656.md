## Implementation approach

To create an engaging and personalized English learning app, we'll leverage Flask for the backend to manage user data, sessions, and API endpoints. For the frontend, React will provide a dynamic and responsive user interface. SQLite will serve as the database for storing flashcards, quizzes, and user progress. We'll incorporate the spaced repetition algorithm for adaptive learning, and utilize Chart.js for progress visualization. The app will be designed with a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specifics of the spaced repetition algorithm for adaptive learning, particularly on how to effectively integrate it with user progress data.
