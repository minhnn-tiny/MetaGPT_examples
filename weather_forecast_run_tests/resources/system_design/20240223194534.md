## Implementation approach

To develop the weather forecast application, we will utilize Python with the Streamlit framework for the UI/UX, ensuring an intuitive user interface. For real-time weather data, we will integrate with the OpenWeatherMap API, a reliable and widely used service. This approach allows us to meet the requirement of not needing additional package installations for execution, as Streamlit and requests (for API calls) are sufficient. We'll focus on creating a responsive, fast-loading application that provides current, hourly, and weekly forecasts across various locations.

    class App {
        +StreamlitUI ui
        +WeatherAPI weather_api
        +main() void
    }
    class StreamlitUI {
        +display_current_weather(data: dict)
        +display_hourly_forecast(data: list)
        +display_weekly_forecast(data: list)
        +search_bar() str
    }
    class WeatherAPI {
        +api_key str
        +base_url str
        +get_current_weather(location: str) dict
        +get_hourly_forecast(location: str) list
        +get_weekly_forecast(location: str) list
    }
    App --> StreamlitUI
    App --> WeatherAPI

    A->>WAPI: get_weekly_forecast(location)
    WAPI-->>A: weekly_forecast_data
    A->>UI: display_weekly_forecast(weekly_forecast_data)


## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific details of the OpenWeatherMap API's response structure are not covered here, assuming general knowledge of such APIs. Further, the handling of API request limits and errors needs to be considered in the implementation phase.
