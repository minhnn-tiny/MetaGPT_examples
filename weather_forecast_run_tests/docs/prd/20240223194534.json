{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"Create Weather Forecast App with integration with 3rd party API to get the data. Use python programming language based on Streamlit. Please make sure others can execute directly without introducing additional packages.","Product Goals":["Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the weather forecast application","Ensure the app provides accurate and real-time weather data","Enable easy deployment and execution without the need for additional package installations"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to view the current weather forecast so that I can plan my day accordingly","As a user, I want to search for weather forecasts in different locations to plan my travels","As a user, I want to see hourly and weekly weather forecasts to have a detailed understanding of weather patterns","As a user, I want the application to load quickly so that I can get the information I need without waiting","As a user, I want to access the app from any device without issues to check the weather anytime, anywhere"],"Competitive Analysis":["Weather.com: Comprehensive weather updates but can be slow to load","AccuWeather: Accurate forecasts with detailed information but contains ads","The Weather Channel App: User-friendly but requires installation of additional features","BBC Weather: Simple interface but limited to UK locations","Yahoo Weather: Visually appealing but lacks detailed forecasts","Weather Underground: Offers detailed data but the interface is cluttered","Dark Sky: Precise weather forecasts but no longer available for Android"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Usability and Feature Richness\"\n    x-axis \"Low Usability\" --> \"High Usability\"\n    y-axis \"Basic Features\" --> \"Advanced Features\"\n    quadrant-1 \"Need Improvement\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Feature Rich but Complex\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Simple and Basic\"\n    quadrant-4 \"Ideal Target: High Usability with Advanced Features\"\n    \"Weather.com\": [0.7, 0.8]\n    \"AccuWeather\": [0.8, 0.7]\n    \"The Weather Channel App\": [0.6, 0.6]\n    \"BBC Weather\": [0.5, 0.4]\n    \"Yahoo Weather\": [0.9, 0.5]\n    \"Weather Underground\": [0.4, 0.9]\n    \"Dark Sky\": [0.8, 0.8]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.9, 0.9]","Requirement Analysis":"The project requires the development of a weather forecast application using Python and Streamlit, integrating with a 3rd party API for weather data. The app should be user-friendly, provide real-time and accurate weather forecasts, and be easily executable without additional package installations. It should cater to users' needs for current, hourly, and weekly weather updates across various locations.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Integrate with a reliable 3rd party weather API to fetch real-time data"],["P0","Develop the application using Streamlit for an intuitive UI/UX"],["P1","Implement search functionality for weather forecasts in different locations"],["P1","Ensure the application is responsive and loads quickly across devices"],["P2","Provide detailed hourly and weekly weather forecasts"]],"UI Design draft":"The app will feature a clean and minimalistic design. The main page will display the current weather forecast, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A search bar at the top allows users to search for weather in different locations. Tabs for hourly and weekly forecasts will be available for more detailed information. The design will be responsive to ensure usability across various devices.","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
