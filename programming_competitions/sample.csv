All submissions for this problem are available. Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Akhil comes across a string S of length N. He started wondering about the smallest lexicographical subsequence of string S of length K.
A subsequence of a string is formed by deleting some characters (possibly none) from it's original string.
A string A is said to be lexicographically smaller than the string B of the same length if at the first position where A and B differ, A contains a letter which appears earlier in the dictionary than the corresponding letter in B.
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows:
First line of each test case will contain string S
Second line of each test case will contain an integer K.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the lexicographically smallest subsequence of S of length K.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ K ≤ N
S consists of lowercase English alphabet characters, i.e. from 'a' to 'z'.

135,COOKOFF2,The Grand Cook Off,/problems/COOKOFF2,medium,"
All submissions for this problem are available.
Chef is planning a grand cooking tournament for aspiring chefs in the region.
The competition progresses with a number of one-on-one elimination rounds until only one chef remains.
For each round, two chefs are chosen at random for a cook-off.
The loser of the cook-off is elimited, while the winner moves on.
Additionally, each chef begins with a positive number of prize tokens
(some chefs begin with more than others, based on their performance in a qualification round).
The winner of each cook-off receives all of the loser's prize tokens, and the loser is
awarded a prize based on the number of prize tokens he/she had accrued.
The final cook-off always receives the most publicity.
Your task it to compute the expected difference between the number of prize tokens of the final two
competitors before the final cook-off.
You will be given the number of tokens each chef begins with.
Input
Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases (at most 50).
Each test case consists of a single line, beginning with an integer C,
the number of chefs in the competition, followed by C positive integers each describing the number
of prize tokens a chef begins with.
The total number of prize tokens among all chefs will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
Output
For each test case, output the expected difference in prize tokens, rounded to 6 places
after the decimal point.

136,BLOCKING,Block Game,/problems/BLOCKING,medium,"
All submissions for this problem are available.
In the magic land, there is a smart but naughty boy Crane.
Crane has n houses, and n friends (both numbered from 1 to n).
Crane's mother has scheduled a plan for all his friends
such that each friend visits each house of Crane exactly once
at a different time, i.e.,
there is at most one friend in any house at any time.
But like Crane all his friends are also naughty.
Therefore his mother wants to lock away each of his friends in distinct houses.
What she'll do is to choose a distinct house for each friend. As that friend visits
that house, he'll be locked in that house.  That is, Crane's mother wants to find a
sequence block such that
the i-th friend will be locked in block[i]-th house
once he visits that house. As she wants to ensure that there is at maximum one
person in each house, she must choose the sequence block such
that if friend A visits house H at time T, and he is locked away in the house, then no other friends visit house H
after time T. 
Help Crane's mother to find such a sequence block. 
Input
First line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n
≤ 100), indicating the number of friends and houses.
Then n lines follow, with each line containing n positive integers.
The j-th integer in i-th line indicates the time when the i-th friend will visit the j-th house. All times will fit in signed 32-bit integer.
Output
If there exists a sequence block that satisfies the constraints, then output block[1] block[2] ... block[n] in one line, separated by a single space.
Otherwise if there is no such sequence, output -1 in one line.
If there are multiple answers, then anyone will do.

166,TEAMSEL,Team Selection,/problems/TEAMSEL,hard,"
All submissions for this problem are available.
One of the cherished customs of my childhood was choosing up sides for a cricket game. We did it this way: The two bullies of our gully would appoint themselves captains of the opposing teams, and then they would take turns picking other players. On each round, a captain would choose the most capable (or, towards the end, the least inept) player from the pool of remaining candidates, until everyone present had been assigned to one side or the other. The aim of this ritual was to produce two evenly matched teams and, along the way, to remind each of us of our precise ranking in the neighbourhood pecking order.
We all believed this was the fairest process, but does it ensure the fairest selection of players with evenly matched teams? We believed so, but then there were times when, as the game progressed we realized that the other team was stronger than ours and may be an exchange of a couple of players between the teams would have made them balanced. That scope of improvement seemed to be there...
Here, we need to find a way to create two evenly balanced teams for any game(or as evenly balanced as possible considering the strength of each player). A set of players must be divided into two teams. Each player must be on one team or the other; the number of player on the two teams must not differ by more than 1; each player will have a skill-point associated with him. The total skill-points of the players on each team should be as nearly equal as possible.(The absolute difference of the sum of skill-points of players in each team should be the least).
Input
The first line of input will contain the number of test cases 'T'(1<=T<=100). This is followed by 'T' test cases. Each test case starts with a blank line, followed by N, the total number of players. N lines will follow with the first line giving the skill-point of person 1; the second line, the skill-point of person 2; and so on. Each skill-point shall be an integer between 1 and 450. There shall be at most 100 players in all(1<=N<=100).
Output
Your output should be exactly '2T-1' lines. The output for each test case should be followed by a blank line, except the output for the last test case. Each odd numbered line should contain 2 numbers: the total skill-points of the players on one team, and the total skill-points of the players on the other team. Print the smaller sum first.

All submissions for this problem are available. Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Kekocity's population consist of N gnomes numbered with unique ids from 1 to N. As they are very joyful gnomes, they usually send jokes to their friends right after they get any (even if they knew it before) via their social network named as Mybeard. Mybeard became popular in the city because of message auto-deletion. It takes exactly one minute to read and resend joke to mates.

Mayor of Kekocity, Mr. Shaikhinidin, is interested in understanding how the jokes are spread. He gives you database of Mybeard social network, and wants you to answer some queries on it.

You will be given a list of friends for every gnome and M queries of the following type: Who will receive a message with joke after exactly K minutes, if the creator of joke was gnome with id x?
Input
The first line contains a single integer N denoting the number of gnomes.
The next N lines contain the the matrix g[N][N]. Each of the i-th line, will contain N space separated integers - j-th of those will denote g[i][j]. If gnome j is friend of gnome i, then g[i][j] is 1. Otherwise it will be zero. Plese note that the friendship relationship is not bidirectional, i.e. it might happen that g[i][j] may not be equal to g[j][i]. Also one can be friend of itself also, i.e. g[i][i] may be equal to 1.
The next line contains a single integer M denoting the number of queries. The next M lines contain two integers k and x described above.
Output
For each query, output two lines.
In the first line, output how many gnomes will know the joke after k minutes.
In the second line, print these ids (numbering) of these gnomes in increasing order. If no one will know the joke after K minutes, then print -1 in this line.

384,TEAMSIZE,Team Formation,/problems/TEAMSIZE,medium,"
All submissions for this problem are available.

Battle of the Chefs is coming up! It's a contest where different teams of different Chefs compete against each other. Our Chef wants to send one of the best teams from his entire staff. Selecting a good team is not about having the best people, but it is about having members who can cooperate and work well with each other. Chef is very aware of this fact. So he chooses the following strategy to decide a team. He lines up all his N cooks in a line. Each of these cooks has a skill level associated with him. Denote the level of the i-th cook as skill[i] for 1 ≤ i ≤ N. Let us make a few points on a team formation.


A team can have any number of cooks.
Each team should consist of consecutive cooks. So, for example, cooks with positions 3, 4, 5 can form a team, but cooks with positions 4, 5, 7, 8 can not.
A team is a candidate team if the difference between the maximum skill and the minimum skill of the cooks in the team does not exceed the threshold C.
A cook can be in 0 or more candidate teams. Which means that candidate teams can intersect.
Two candidate teams are considered to be different if there exists at least one cook who is in one team but not in the other.



Chef has not yet decided the team of what size he is going to send to the battle. To be precise we note, that the team size is the total number of cooks in it. For the given team size Chef wants to consider all candidate teams of this size according to the rules described above, evaluate them for himself and choose the best one. Denote the total number of candidate teams for the given size K as cand[K]. To increase the chances of choosing better team he wants the number of candidate teams to be as large as possible. But Chef is a human and can't evaluate too many teams. The maximal number of teams he can evaluate depends on many factors such as his mood or fatigue. We call it the Chef's limit. Denote the current Chef's limit as M. Since Chef still wants the total number of candidate teams to be as large as possible you need to find the team size K such that cand[K] ≤ M, among all such K find the value for which cand[K] is maximal and if such K is not unique find the minimal K among them. Since Chef's limit always changes according to his mood or fatigue you should find the required team size for several values of M. Chef also wants to know the total number of candidate teams for the size you will find. There will be Q values of M in all.


In order to keep the input small the skills of the cooks will be given in the following way.

Skills of the first X cooks are given in the input, where X = min(10000, N).
If N > 10000 skills of the remaining cooks for 10000 < i ≤ N are calculated as
skill[i] = (A * skill[i-1] + B * skill[i-2] + D) mod 230,
where A, B and D are given in the input. Here mod denotes the modulo operation, that is, Y mod Z is the remainder of division of Y by Z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases to follow.
Each test case consists of 3 lines.
The first line contains 6 space-separated integers N, C, Q, A, B and D.
The second line contains X = min(N, 10000) space-separated integers, i-th integer among them represents the skill of the i-th cook, that is, the number skill[i].
The third line contains Q space-separated integers, the values of M for which you need to find the optimal team size and the number of candidate teams of this size.

Output

For each test case, output Q lines containing the optimal team size for the corresponding value of M and the number of candidate teams corresponding to this team size separated by a space.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 500000
0 ≤ C < 230
1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000
0 ≤ A, B, D < 230

Explanation

Case 1.
With team size 2, we have 4 candidate teams: {2, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6}, and {6, 3}. Here numbers denote the cooks' skills. With any other team size, the number of candidate teams is either less than 4 or greater than 4.
Similarly, with team size 3, we have 3 candidate teams, which are {2, 4, 5}, {4, 5, 6} and {5, 6, 3}.
With team size 1, we have 6 candidate teams with one member in each team.


Case 2.
With team size 1, we have 6 possible candidate teams. But 6 > 4. For all other team sizes, the total number of candidate teams is 0. Thus, the answer is the smallest size among them, i.e., 2.

All submissions for this problem are available. Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Forking is an important tactics in the game of chess. A piece is said to perform a fork if 
1) It is on a safe square, i.e., the next move by the opponent does not kill the piece
2) It targets atleast 2 of the opponents pieces in its next move. So even if the opponent moves one of his pieces to safety, one of his remaining pieces can be killed.

You are given an NxN board, containing M White Queens. Remember, a Queen can move vertically, horizontally and diagonally; and kills any opponents piece directly in these directions. A Knight has 8 possible moves from position (i,j), viz (i+1,j+2), (i+1,j-2), (i-1,j+2), (i-1,j-2), (i+2,j+1), (i+2,j-1), (i-2,j+1), (i-2,j-1) (while remaining inside the NxN board). You have to find out the number of unoccupied positions on the NxN board, where a Black Knight can be placed such that it forks atleast 2 Queens.

INPUT:
First line contains T, number of testcases
Each testcase starts with a line containing two integers N and M

Summers in Kharagpur are Hot. And Humid! It’s pretty rough for students who are new to KGP and are not used to the sweating it can cause.
The students want to minimize the amount of sweat while walking from their hostels to class. When they enter the sunshine, they begin sweating. The longer they stay in the sun, the more they sweat.
Precisely, if the Euclidean distance between points A and B is d, then a student sweats d2 units when going from A to B without stopping anywhere on the way. But if they stop at a shady spot on the way (like a tree), their continuous sun exposure is broken, and they stop sweating immediately! So they can sit in the shade of the tree and cool off before resuming their journey. Once they leave the shade, they start sweating again.
For example, if a student goes from his room A0 to class An+1 while stopping at n trees in between for shade, the total sweat produced is
d(A0,A1)2 + d(A1,A2)2 + …… + d(An,An+1)2
Your task is to help the students find a path from their rooms to class in such a way that they sweat the minimum.
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10), the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases one by one.
For each test case, the first line contains a single integer N (0 ≤ N ≤ 2500) indicating the number of trees on campus. The next N lines each contain a pair of integers denoting the 2D co-ordinates of each tree. The absolute value of each coordinate is less than or equal to 1000. No two trees have the same location. Then there are 2 additional lines – the co-ordinates of the student’s room and the classroom respectively.
Output
Print a single integer for each test case on a line by itself, the minimum amount of sweat that should be expended when a student goes from his room to class.

Today is the planned day tor Thik and Ayvak's wedding. Kark is infatuated with Ayvak. He offers to play a game with Thik. Whosoever wins, will get to marry Ayvak. Ayvak, who values games of chance over all the other things in life, agrees to this.


Kark sets up an N by M grid (N rows, M columns), labelled from left to right and top to bottom consecutively with numbers from 1 to M*N, with 1 at the top left corner and M*N at the bottom right corner. For example, a labelled 3 by 6 grid looks as follows:



Kark has already painted K unit squares of the grid with a heart each. Next, Thik randomly picks a rectangle with sides on the grid lines, and having a positive area, with each valid rectangle having an equal probability of being chosen. Three distinct possibilities for Thik's rectangle in the 3 by 6 grid are shown below: 




The nine different rectangles in a 2 by 2 grid are shown below:





If Thik's rectangle contains at least half of the hearts, Thik gets to marry Ayvak. Otherwise, Kark will marry Ayvak. Kark wants to know whether or not he has an advantage here, so he wants to know the expected value of the number of hearts a randomly chosen rectangle will cover. I'm sure that you have a good heart, so please, cover this job for him. 

Input
The first line of input contains one integer T, the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains 3 space-separated integers N, M, K, as described in the problem statement. The next line contains K space-separated integers, each a single number from 1 to M*N, representing a square that is painted with a heart. It is guaranteed that all K integers are distinct.
Output
Output T lines, each containing a single real number, containing the expected number of hearts that a randomly chosen rectangle will contain. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 10-6.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 5  
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 107  
1 ≤ K ≤ 105 
Each of the K integers representing a heart are between 1 and N*M, inclusive. All K integers are distinct.

Explanation
There are a total of 9 possible rectangles Thik could draw, shown in the figure above, and grid squares 1 and 2 are painted with a heart. The top row of possible selections (shown in the figure) contain 1, 0, 1, 2, and 2 hearts (from left to right), and the bottom row of possible selections (in the figure) contain 1, 0, 1, and 0 hearts. Therefore, 3/9 of the time 0 hearts are contained in the rectangle, 4/9 of the times 1 heart is contained in the rectangle, and 2/9 of the time 2 hearts are contained in the rectangle. The expected value is then 0 * 3/9 + 1 * 4/9 + 2 * 2/9 = 8/9.

Chef studied science at school. But now he was tired of it. He likes to solve problems on Codechef. Here and now, he decided to go to his favourite site and solve several interesting problems. But as it turned out Chef is not yet ready to solve the harder problems. So you have to help him.

If you take away all the foreword, then the task set is this: you have N non-negative numbers A1, A2 ... AN and M requests. Each request consists of three numbers (l, v, k). MagicInteger(l,v) is equal to concatenation of the numbers Ai, such that (i = l + v * q & 1 <= i <= n & q >= 0). For each such request you have to write the k-th digit of MagicInteger(l,v).


Concatanation example:
If you have 2 numbers 11, 22 - after concatenation you will have 1122.
If you have 3 number 13, 44, 12 - after concatenation you will have 134412.
One more example: 0, 3, 11, 0 - after concatenation you will have 03110. First digit of this string is 0, not 3.

 
Input
The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of integers in the given array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the given array. The third line has a single integer M denoting the number of requests. The next M lines contains three space separated numbers in each line (l, v, k) denoting each request. 
Output
For each request output a single line containing k-th digit of MagicInteger(l, v). If the length of MagicInteger(l,v) is smaller than k, you need to output ""So sad"" without quotes.

658,HELLO,Hello Hello,/problems/HELLO,easy,"
All submissions for this problem are available.Chef talks a lot on his mobile phone. As a result he exhausts his talk-value (in Rokdas) very quickly. One day at a mobile recharge shop, he noticed that his service provider gives add-on plans which can lower his calling rates (Rokdas/minute). One of the plans said ""Recharge for 28 Rokdas and enjoy call rates of 0.50 Rokdas/min for one month"". Chef was very pleased. His normal calling rate is 1 Rokda/min. And he talked for 200 minutes in last month, which costed him 200 Rokdas. If he had this plan activated, it would have costed him: 28 + 0.5*200 = 128 Rokdas only! Chef could have saved 72 Rokdas. But if he pays for this add-on and talks for very little in the coming month, he may end up saving nothing or even wasting money. Now, Chef is a simple guy and he doesn't worry much about future. He decides to choose the plan based upon his last month’s usage.
There are numerous plans. Some for 1 month, some for 15 months. Some reduce call rate to 0.75 Rokdas/min, some reduce it to 0.60 Rokdas/min. And of course each of them differ in their activation costs. Note - If a plan is valid for M months, then we must pay for (re)activation after every M months (once in M months). Naturally, Chef is confused, and you (as always) are given the task to help him choose the best plan.
Input
First line contains T- the number of test cases. In each test case, first line contains D- the default rate (Rokdas/minute, real number), U- the number of minutes Chef talked in last month and N- the number of add-on plans available. Then N lines follow, each containing M- the number of months the plan is valid for, R- the calling rate for the plan (Rokdas/minute, real number) and C- the cost of the plan.
Output
For each test case, output one integer- the number of the best plan (from 1 to N). Output '0' if no plan is advantageous for Chef. No two plans are equally advantageous.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.5 ≤ D ≤ 10.0 (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)1 ≤ U ≤ 100001 ≤ N ≤ 1001 ≤ M ≤ 360.05 ≤ R < D (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)1 ≤ C ≤ 1000

Explanation

Similarly had he chosen plan 2, he would have to pay 20 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 2 months.

All submissions for this problem are available. Read problems statements in  Mandarin Chinese  and  Russian.
Cyael is a very gifted girl who loves Magic (she even reached the finals on a very famous tournament in Byteland ;) ) and Computer Science. As we know, CS is a very vast subject and Cyael learns what she can, little by little, by reading the editorials of codechef.com, her favourite programming website.
Today, she came across a problem that was about calculating powers of two, and she got bored of it really fast, as she considers she knows all there is to know about powers of two. She knows how to compute even very big powers, like powers of 10, so it's obvious that for her, powers of two have no secrets :D
But her friend Lira, as she was tired of hearing her boasting about her skills for calculating powers, decided to challenge her with a brand new task: computing what she calls,  SuperPowers of 2 . 
 Cyael: ""Okay Lira, tell me about SuperPower of 2 so that I can solve one more problem and prepare for Codechef's November Long Challenge!! It's less than a month away!""
 Lira: ""I define the Nth Superpower of 2 as being the number (2N_bin)2 , where N_bin stands for the decimal number encoded by the representation in base 2 of the number N.
So, for example, the 2nd SuperPower of 2 is then equal to the number:
(210)2 = 1048576
 because,  N = 2 , and its binary encoding is 10 in decimal it is ten. So 210 = 1024 and 10242 = 1048576 
Since the answer can be large, you are asked to compute SuperPowers of 2 modulo 1000000007.""
After some time, Cyael finally solved the problem and decided to call Lira:
 Cyael: ""Well, I admit I struggled more than I'd have expected on this problem... You should consider becoming a problem setter and set this problem for Codechef... Do you want me to call Bruno and ask him to set this problem on your behalf? He always finds a way of writing a fun problem statement!!"" 
 Lira: ""Wooow!! That means Codechef community would solve my problem, modified by Bruno himself? Please do so, I'd love it!!!"" 
 And now, here I am (yes, Bruno :D ) setting Lira's problem to all of you, but, with some differences regarding Lira's initial version, which hopefully you will appreciate. 
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Then on the following T lines, there is an integer N, denoting the index of the SuperPower of 2 you need to compute modulo 1000000007.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the required value: the Nth SuperPower of 2 modulo 1000000007.
Constraints

His friend Dmytro wants to make Chef happy, so he presented this interesting problem for Chef.
Given an array A. You have to process Q queries on it. Queries can be one of two types:

 1 x y  - Assign value y to x-th element in array A, i.e. Ax = y.
2 l r  - print ""Yes"" if subarray A[l..r] is dominating, ""No"" otherwise

Input
The first line of input contains two integers N and Q denoting the number of elements in A, and the number of queries to be executed.

With the impressive achievement in competitive programming Jem was offered an internship at IBER - a tech company that provides an alternative to tradditional taxi service.


Jem first task was help IBER quickly calculate the distance between two arbitrary locations in Jem's city. As an experienced competitive programmer Jem understand that this is not a trivial problem with general graph. Fortunately after investigate the city map Jem found out that the roads system is have a special form which may make Jem's problem easier to deal with.


There are N locations in the city and M bidirectional road connecting them. Each road i have the length of Ci and no two road connect the same pair of locations. The roads system is designed in a way that from a specific location one can travel to any other locations. The most important point is that there is no location belong to more than one cycle in the graph corresponding to road network.


So Jem already got his solution. If you want to secure an internship at IBER maybe you can try to solve this problem too!

Input



    The first line of the input contains two number N and M


    In the next M line each line contains three numbers u, v and c represent a road of length c connects location u and v.
  

    Next line contains a single number Q represents the number of queries.
  

    In the next Q lines each line contains two numbers u and v corresponding to a query of the length of the shortest path between location u and v.
  


Output

For each query print out the corresponding result in one line.

This problem was part of the CodeChef April Challenge.  All user submissions for this contest problem are publicly available here.
Shaheen has bought some gifts for a friend, which are wrapped up in several boxes of different sizes (all of which are full). She will need to carry the gifts a long way to her friend's house, so she would prefer to add some extra packing, and accommodate everything in one extra box. Moreover, to avoid damaging the contents, she does not wish to place more than two boxes directly within any box; however, boxes can be placed within boxes which contain other boxes, etc. A box which is used for holding two boxes of sizes a and b will have size a+b, and will cost Shaheen a+b coins at the local store. Please help Shaheen determine the minimum cost required to achieve the complete packing, and the number of different possible packings (arrangements of boxes within each other) having such a minimal cost.
Input
The first line of input is n <=2000, the number of boxes with Shaheen's gifts. The next n lines of input contain one positive integer each, not greater than 106, representing the sizes of the successive boxes.

As part of his daily job, Chef has to solve problems involving sets. Till now, Chef has been using inefficient methods to solve his set related problem, wasting a lot of his precious time. He has agreed to pay you a lot of money for solving the following problem for him efficiently.


First, Chef needs to perform Q operations on a set. Each operation is either:

1. Add a number to the set (if this number is NOT already present in the set).
2. Erase a number from the set (if this number exists in the set).


Then, he needs to find the sum of all elements of the set after performing these Q queries. Your job is to find this sum for him quickly.

Input
The first line of input contains four integers — Q, S1, A, B. S1 is the first number in the operations. A and B are special constants explained later.

Every operation Si is represented by a single integer. If Si is odd, then it represents the first operation, otherwise the second type, and in both of them the integer you have to add/delete equals [Si / 2], where [] is the greatest integer (or floor) function.

Si = (A*Si-1 + B) mod 232 when i > 1.


Note: In this problem, the time limit is very tight. Using built-in data structures, such as set/unordered_set in C++ or TreeSet/HashSet in Java, may lead to a Time Limit Exceed verdict.

Output
Output a single line containing a single integer — sum of elements in the set after Q queries.

Constraints

1 ≤ Q ≤ 107
1 ≤ S1, A, B ≤ 109

Output:

Explanation:

The sequence {Si} is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:

Operation 1, 1 mod 2 = 1, add number [1 / 2] = 0 to set, sum is 0.


Operation 2, 2 mod 2 = 0, erase number [2 / 2] = 1 from set, 1 is not in set, so nothing happens, sum is 0.


Operation 3, 3 mod 2 = 1, add number [3 / 2] = 1 to set, sum is 1.


Operation 4, 4 mod 2 = 0, erase number [4 / 2] = 2 from set, 2 is not in set, so nothing happens, sum is 1.


Operation 5, 5 mod 2 = 1, add number [5 / 2] = 2 to set, sum is 3.

It's autumn now, the time of the leaf fall.
Sergey likes to collect fallen leaves in autumn. In his city, he can find fallen leaves of maple, oak and poplar. These leaves can be of three different colors: green, yellow or red.
Sergey has collected some leaves of each type and color. Now he wants to create the biggest nice bouquet from them. He considers the bouquet nice iff all the leaves in it are either from the same type of tree or of the same color (or both). Moreover, he doesn't want to create a bouquet with even number of leaves in it, since this kind of bouquets are considered to attract bad luck. However, if it's impossible to make any nice bouquet, he won't do anything, thus, obtaining a bouquet with zero leaves.
Please help Sergey to find the maximal number of leaves he can have in a nice bouquet, which satisfies all the above mentioned requirements.
Please note that Sergey doesn't have to use all the leaves of the same color or of the same type. For example, if he has 20 maple leaves, he can still create a bouquet of 19 leaves.

1295,XRMTRX,Xor Matrix,/problems/XRMTRX,hard,"
All submissions for this problem are available. Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Let's consider a square matrix of size N × N, where N = R −­­­­­­­­­­­ L + 1. We will enumerate the columns of this matrix with consecutive integers from L to R (the leftmost column will be assigned number L and the rightmost - number R). In similar manner we will enumerate rows with the same integers (the top row will be assigned number L and the bottom row - number R).
Every cell of this matrix has an integer written inside it. The cell at the intersection of row X and column Y has integer (X xor Y) written inside.
Two cells are called adjacent if and only if they have a common side. That way every inner cell have 4 neighbors and any of four corner cells have 2 neighbors.
A walk is a sequence of cells C0, C1, C2, ..., CK, where for every 1 ≤ i ≤ K the cells Ci-1 and Ci are adjacent and for every 0 ≤ j ≤ K the number written inside cell Cj is equal j. The number K is the length of that walk.
Your task is for given L and R values, find the maximal possible value of K, as well as the count C of different walks with that maximal length. As the value of C could be very large, output it modulo (109 + 7).
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The description of T test cases follows. 
For each test case, the only line of input contains two integers L and R.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing two integers K and C. The value of C should be printed modulo (109 + 7).
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20 000
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1018

Subtasks

Subtask #1: 1 ≤ T ≤ 500; 0 ≤ R - L ≤ 300 (8 points)
Subtask #2: original constraints, only the value of K will be checked. (24 points)
Subtask #3: original constraints (68 points)

Example
Input:
4
1 1
1 2
1 3
2 3

Output:
0 1
0 2
3 4
1 4
 
Explanation
Example case 1. The matrix contains just one cell, so, there is no possibility to make a single move, thus K = 0. We have just one possibility - to start the walk at the only cell and to end it immediately.
Example case 2. The matrix doesn't contains a cell with number one inside, so, there once again is no possibility to make a single move, thus K = 0. Our walk is just a single cell with number zero inside and there are two such cells, thus C = 2. The matrix in this case looks like this:

(1 xor 1)   (1 xor 2)          =          0 3
(2 xor 1)   (2 xor 2)          =          3 0

Example case 3. The four possible walks are:
0 3 2               0 3 2               0 3 2               0 3 2
3 0 1               3 0 1               3 0 1               3 0 1
2 1 0               2 1 0               2 1 0               2 1 0

Example case 4. The four possible walks are:
0 1                   0 1                   0 1                   0 1
1 0                   1 0                   1 0                   1 0

1363,AUTHEN,Authentication Failed,/problems/AUTHEN,hard,"
All submissions for this problem are available.
Several days ago Chef decided to register at one of the programming sites. For registering he was asked to choose a nickname and a password. There was no problem with choosing a nickname (""Chef"" is his favorite nickname), but choosing a password in a secure way seemed to be a real problem for Chef. Therefore, he decided to write a program which would generate the password of length N consisting of small Latin letters a..z. Then Chef successfully registered at the site and saved the password in a file (as it was too hard to remember).
Today Chef decided to visit the site once again. He entered his nickname, copied the password from the file... ""Authentication failed!"" was the answer. Trying to understand the reason of this, he noticed that the password in his file had length N+K instead of N! Sure enough of the source of the problem, Chef went straight to his young brother.
And Chef was right, it was his brother who had inserted K random small Latin letters at some random positions (possibly at the beginning or at the end) of the password. Chef's brother didn't remember what exactly changes he had made at all, but he promised that he had done nothing besides inserting letters.
As there is no other way to recover the password, Chef is now starting to remove every possible combination of K letters from the password trying to enter (when Chef obtains the same password as one of the previously entered passwords, he doesn't try to enter using this password again). Now the question is: what is the number of times Chef will receive ""Authentication failed!"" as the answer before successful entering in the worst case? As the answer might be quite large, output its remainder of division by 1009419529.
Input
The first line of the input file contains one integer T -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Each test case is described by a line containing two integers N and K (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 100) separated by a single space, followed by a line containing a string of length N+K consisting of small Latin letters a..z.
Output
For each test case output just one line containing the required number modulo 1009419529.
Example

Input:
3
2 1
aaa
3 1
abcd
4 2
ababab

Output:
0
3
10

Explanation:

In the first test case, the password is definitely ""aa"". In the second test case, it can be ""abc"", ""abd"", ""acd"" or ""bcd"", so in the worst case Chef will guess the correct option from the fourth attempt, thus making 3 unsuccessful attempts.
