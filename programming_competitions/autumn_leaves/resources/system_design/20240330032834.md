## Implementation approach

We will use the `collections` module to store the number of leaves of each type and color. We will then iterate over all possible combinations of types and colors to find the maximal number of leaves that can be used to create a nice bouquet.

## File list

- main.py

## Data structures and interfaces


classDiagram
    class Main {
        -leaves: dict[str, dict[str, int]]
        +main() int
    }


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    M->>M: main()


## Anything UNCLEAR
