{"Implementation approach":"To create a Flappy Bird clone that meets the outlined requirements, we will use Python with the Pygame library, which is well-suited for developing 2D games. This approach allows us to focus on game mechanics and design without getting bogged down in low-level details like rendering and event handling. Pygame is open-source and has a large community, making it an ideal choice for this project.","File list":["main.py","game.py","bird.py","pipe.py","score.py","sounds.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        +main() void\n    }\n    class Game {\n        -bird Bird\n        -pipes list\n        -score Score\n        +run() void\n        +restart() void\n    }\n    class Bird {\n        -velocity float\n        -position tuple\n        +flap() void\n        +update() void\n    }\n    class Pipe {\n        -position tuple\n        -gap_size int\n        +move() void\n        +check_collision(Bird) bool\n    }\n    class Score {\n        -current_score int\n        -highest_score int\n        +update() void\n        +reset() void\n    }\n    class Sounds {\n        +play_sound(sound_type) void\n    }\n    Game --> Bird\n    Game --> Pipe\n    Game --> Score\n    Game --> Sounds\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant B as Bird\n    participant P as Pipe\n    participant S as Score\n    participant SO as Sounds\n    M->>G: run()\n    loop Game Loop\n        G->>B: update()\n        G->>P: move()\n        P->>G: check_collision(B)\n        alt is Collision\n            G->>SO: play_sound('hit')\n            G->>G: restart()\n        else No Collision\n            G->>S: update()\n        end\n    end\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the specific requirements for sound effects and music, such as file formats and sourcing."}
