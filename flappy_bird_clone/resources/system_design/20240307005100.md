## Implementation approach

To create a Flappy Bird clone that meets the outlined requirements, we will use Python with the Pygame library, which is well-suited for developing 2D games. This approach allows us to focus on game mechanics and design without getting bogged down in low-level details like rendering and event handling. Pygame is open-source and has a large community, making it an ideal choice for this project.

## Data structures and interfaces

    class Main {
        +main() void
    }
    class Game {
        -bird Bird
        -pipes list
        -score Score
        +run() void
        +restart() void
    }
    class Bird {
        -velocity float
        -position tuple
        +flap() void
        +update() void
    }
    class Pipe {
        -position tuple
        -gap_size int
        +move() void
        +check_collision(Bird) bool
    }
    class Score {
        -current_score int
        -highest_score int
        +update() void
        +reset() void
    }
    class Sounds {
        +play_sound(sound_type) void
    }
    Game --> Bird
    Game --> Pipe
    Game --> Score
    Game --> Sounds


## Program call flow

    participant G as Game
    participant B as Bird
    participant P as Pipe
    participant S as Score
    participant SO as Sounds
    M->>G: run()
    loop Game Loop
        G->>B: update()
        G->>P: move()
        P->>G: check_collision(B)
        alt is Collision
            G->>SO: play_sound('hit')
            G->>G: restart()
        else No Collision
            G->>S: update()
        end
    end


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific requirements for sound effects and music, such as file formats and sourcing.
